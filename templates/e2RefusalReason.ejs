    <h1>Main Reason for E2 Visa Application Refusal</h1>
    <p>
        The main reason for E2 visa application refusal is that the business doesn't show that it will generate enough revenue to create jobs for Americans.
        It doesn't matter how many people you will employ, but it should demonstrate that the United States will benefit from your presence.

        This information is crucial for your business plan to ensure a successful E2 visa application.
        Make sure to include details in your plan that clearly illustrate the positive impact of your business on the U.S. economy and job market.
